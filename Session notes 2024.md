## The 2 stone pillars in the woods aka Casimar's First Dungeon

| Date | Party
|-|-
| 18 - November | Gervian, Casimar

After a somewhat disturbed night's rest, we woke up with a new mystery on our hands.
The party decided on having some breakfast first before checking out what is what with the tree stump we found last night.
With breakfast in our bellies, we went to check it out, walking a whole 15 - 20 meters from our campsite.
Gervian went to inspect it up close, finding out that it was a well concealed stone structure, definitely fabricated. Where there first came noises from the pipe, it now seems to be all quite. Nothing to do here, but wonder more what this construction is.

In a short discussion what to do next, Gervian opted to go and speak with Fenelor again. Let's try and pry some more information off of this walking shrub.

Instead of walking back to the road and following that, we decided to just hike through the woods, as we have a good idea which way to go. After a short travel we noticed 2 stone columns standing in the distance. Advancing further we found that they were quite big, roughly 1.5m x 1.5m x 4.5m made of regular stone found in the region, all weathered and mossy. Standing tall in a clearing in the woods, between the pillars appears to be a stone stairwell going down for a few meters. How deep exactly we cannot tell.

In awe of this siting we decided to light a lantern and travel down the stairs.

We transferred a long way down, ending up in a darkened hallway, about 20 foot long, with some stairs leading down at the end. This stonework felt like home to me, although it they are not neatly and fancily carved out as I am used, it still feels very familiar.
On both sides of the hallway were arrow slits, next too them a door. As I looked to the slits, I found out there were rooms. The rooms seemed to be abandoned and deserted for some time already and one of them also had a weapon rack, with some simple spears.
The doors were big, sturdy and reinforced. Wanting to inspect the room with the weapons, I tried to open the door, but alas, it was impossible to open and seemed to be barred from the inside.

Taking in a bit more of the environment, there is a putrid smell in the air. Though there is somewhat of a draft going on, meaning that these tunnels are closed off.

*Could that pipe we found in the wounds near our last camp be an air vent of sorts?*

The breeze has whiff of excrements, death and decay... No idea of what *yet*, as we did not encounter anything yet, I am hoping it is just from the forest animals.

As we advance deeper down this corridor, we descent about 1.5m down on a set of stairs.
Entering a dome shaped area with some sort of well in the middle of about √ò 1.5m. One side has a narrow pathway leading to the other side, the other side has some chains running from wall down into the well. The chains have a red-brownish color, rust I assume.
On the other side of the area runs a short corridor, splitting left and right.

We crossed the area via the small pathway on the side, entering the hallway. Heading in the left corridor, we found a door to the right and another short corridor to the left with a few flights of stairs in the middle.

As curiosity arose, Gervian tried to open up the door on the right. The door was very heavy with very rusty squeaky hinges. Pushing it open made that clear very quickly, because of the loud noises, something in the vicinity probably got startled and threw something over.
In an ill attempt Casimar tried to help out by burning down the door, but it would probably take quite a long time before this would be done.
So, being eager to find out what is behind this door, I pulled the door open with all his might, making a hell of a racket.

Half deafened we here found a small hallway with another door on the other end of it. On the left side in this hallway there was an alcove with 3 buttons, above the buttons some sort of glyphs we've never seen before. We cannot make out what these glyphs represent or say. Also in the alcove is a brazier mounted up on the wall.
Having no idea what the buttons are for and what they do, we decided to leave them for what they are right now and explore the dungeons further.

So, turning backwards, we carefully head into the corridor at the left side. Upon some thorough investigation Gervian found a pressure plate on top of the little stairs. "Let's not step on this tile..."
Advancing to the door, Gervian opened it with some more squeaking, but not as ear-deafening much as the previous one.

\* This is were it gets a little fuzzy, due to brain overload üòÇ

The room we just entered is about a 4.5m x 4.5m, with an arrow-slit and a barred metal gate? There are also some stone shelfs in the wall and an assortment of small chests. After a short inspection of the chests I figured out they are old arrow cases.
After a quick peak through the arrow slit, I saw an area with some light coming from above. Also on the opposite a same set of gate and slit, but mirrored to the current room.

## The Green Wall - extended

| Date | Party
|-|-
| 11 - November | Gervian, Casimar, Echo

*The party is in combat with "the wall".*

*3 Vine like creatures appear from the wall whilst Casimar's magical fire is burning away a part of said wall.*

When the creatures came out of the wall they attacked Casimar and Gervian with hundreds of the thorns flying through the air. Immediately turning Casimar into an inside-out like looking porcupine, causing him to become the first casualty. Gervian also takes some damage whilst trying to chop away at this Blights. In the meantime, Echo is making epic shots from behind a tree, making the adversaries a pile of matchsticks one by one, alas not in time fore Gervian goes down.

Leaving Echo to be the soul survivor of this adventure, out of the burnt away hedge, a female - green, bark-like skin - steps out of her hiding, advancing towards Gervian.

While holding a sharpened wooden staff to Gervian's chest she tells Echo firmly "Take your friends and leave!".

*Echo starts hauling the bodies out of the combat zone.*

The woman walks up to Echo and they have a little chat; she introduces herself as __Fenelor__ (Dryad) and claims she owns this parts of the woods (The Kester Wildernis). Out of compassion Fenelor hands Echo 2 Goodberries if she promises to leave the premises, telling Echo "If you give 'your friends' a berry each, they will come to."

*Echo feeds Casimar and Gervian both a berry and they both awake not knowing what happened after they fell unconscious in battle.*

*Echo brings them up to speed and after a short rest, healing some wounds the party decides to walk back to there previous campsite.*

After coming back to the camp, the party decided to go foraging for firewood and food. Casimar built a small campfire; Echo went to get firewood and found a big tasty looking mushroom; Gervian went out looking for a game trail and set up a snare.

When everyone returned to camp we huddled up around the campfire and talked about what happened and our next course of action. We also inspected the mushroom Echo found, which after identifying it was Chicken of the Woods, a very yummy mushroom.

2 Hours past and Casimar and Gervian decided to check up on the share. After a few minutes of walking they tracked the snare and found a hare caught in the trap. The ground floor had some rustled up leaves and dirt, it tried to escape of course. Gervian undid the snare from the hare, immediately cutting its throat to bleed it out and check if there was any blood at all. After undoing the snare and stowing the rope they return to there camp.

Happily showing the efforts of the hunt, the party cooked and ate like royals. Well, royals in the woods. With some proper Chicken of the Woods steaks and some lovely grilled hare in there bellies time came to set up a watch schedule and go to sleep.

While I was deep in dreamland, I got woken up by Casimar and Echo who heard low growling noises near the camp. The noises seemed to come from a hollowed out tree stump, not accessible to us by any means. Deciding that we could not do anything with (or about) it, and went back to sleep for an extra hour.
