## The Green Wall - extended

| Date | Party
|-|-
| 11 - November | Gervian, Casimar, Echo

*The party is in combat with "the wall".*

*3 Vine like creatures appear from the wall whilst Casimar's magical fire is burning away a part of said wall.*

When the creatures come out of the wall they make attacked Casimar and Gervian with hundreds of the thorns. Immediately turning Casimar into an inside-out like looking porcupine, causing him to become the first casualty. Gervian also takes some damage whilst trying to chop away at this Blights. In the meantime, Echo is making epic shots from behind a tree, making the adversaries a pile of matchsticks one by one, alas not in time fore Gervian goes down.

Leaving Echo to be the soul survivor of this adventure, out of the burnt away hedge, a female - green, bark-like skin - steps out of her hiding, advancing towards Gervian.

While holding a sharpened wooden staff to Gervian's chest she tells Echo firmly "Take your friends and leave!".

*Echo starts hauling the bodies out of the combat zone.*

The woman walks up to Echo and they have a little chat; she introduces herself as __Fenelor__ (Dryad) and claims she owns this parts of the woods (The Kester Wildernis). Out of compassion Fenelor hands Echo 2 Goodberries if she promises to leave the premises, telling Echo "If you give 'your friends' a berry each, they will come to."

*Echo feeds Casimar and Gervian both a berry and they both awake not knowing what happened after they fell unconscious in battle.*

*Echo brings them up to speed and after a short rest, healing some wounds the party decides to walk back to there previous campsite.*

After coming back to the camp, the party decided to go foraging for firewood and food. Casimar built a small campfire; Echo went to get firewood and found a big tasty looking mushroom; Gervian went out looking for a game trail and set up a snare.

When everyone returned to camp we huddled up around the campfire and talked about what happened and our next course of action. We also inspected the mushroom Echo found, which after identifying it was Chicken of the Woods, a very jummy mushroom.

2 Hours past and Casimar and Gervian decided to check up on the share. After a few minutes of walking they tracked the snare and found a hare caught in the trap. The ground floor had some russeled up leaves and dirt, it tried to escape of course. Gervian undid the snare from the hare, imidiatly cutting its throat to bleed it out and check if there was any blood at all. After undoing the snare and stowing the rope they return to there camp.

Happily showing the efforts of the hunt, the party cooked and ate like royals. Well, royals in the woods. With ome proper Chicken of the Woods steaks and some lovely grilled hare in there bellies time came to set up a watch schedule and go to sleep.

While I was deep in dreamland, I got woken up by Casimar and Echo who heared low growling noises near the camp. The noises seemed to come from a hollowed out treestump, not accessable to us by any means. Deciding that we could not do anything with (or about) it, and went back to sleep for an extra hour.
