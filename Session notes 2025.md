## Rat-folk, a guardhouse, bloody rain, a curious note and a portcullis

| 20 - January | Casimar, Echo, Gervian, Leon | Tura, ? | Aviana, Skrix |

After hearing Leon yell we are under attack Gervian storms out to assess the situation. Taking cover behind a pile of rubble that is laying in the streets. Seeing 5 bogeys, rat-like people carrying some simple slings. A sling does not sound like a lot, but I can now tell you that a pebble being flung to the face hurts more than you think.

Whilst still being a bit dazed, Echo managed to shoot one of this enemies that was barging right at me.
Thinking to myself "What the hell this place? Weird skies, even weirder enemies..." while I take aim at one of this creatures. I release the perfect shot on my mark, hitting it so much power, it became a push-shot back into some old weathered bench rendering this quite dead.

After Leon commanded Aviana to go inside the house where Casimar still is, he sees a slightly better dressed rat on top of the old ruins across the street. This one wears a robe, simple short sword and a hand crossbow, this could be there leader. He fires his crossbow at Leon again and yells something I could barely hear, it sounded like broken common, but I could not really make out what it was shouting.

Leon runs in to fight this leader type, as the other 2 rat-folk scurry off into the distance. All eyes on Leon now fighting this bogey, taking serious damage as the rat is ferociously fast and cunning. The rest of the party is now involved in defeating this sly creature.

Before our eyes we saw Leon falling to ground, Gervian drops his bow and starts running in to protect his comrade from dying even more. Casimar and Echo also taking turn shooting and firing at this leader.
After taking some substantial damage, he decided to tuck tail and run off, giving me some space to heal up Leon a bit.

"Skrix is coming back for you!" We hear the leader shouting from the top of a ruined building as a final warning before disappearing completely. Thus concluding a short little battle.

Having some time to see and collect which of the arrows are still usable and inspect the bodies of the rat-folk we took down.
Upon closer inspection of one of them, I discovered it had some glass like fibers stuck in it's gums and between it's teeth.
But alas, no valuables or notion of whom they are, where we are or what so ever.

> What is this glass-like dust?
