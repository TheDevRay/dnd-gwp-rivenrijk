After being halted by some men on the road to Sweel, we continue this exciting adventure, by talking to those people. As soon as we figured out they were the men of the Silver's Put Revenue Administration, we tried to talk our way into the village to complete the current assignment.

| 27 - January | Casimar, Echo, Gervian, Leon | Tura, ? | Aviana, Skrix |

After hearing Leon yell we are under attack Gervian storms out to assess the situation. Taking cover behind a pile of rubble that is laying in the streets. Seeing 5 bogeys, rat-like people carrying some simple slings. A sling does not sound like a lot, but I can now tell you that a pebble being flung to the face hurts more than you think.

Whilst still being a bit dazed, Echo managed to shoot one of this enemies that was barging right at me.
Thinking to myself "What the hell this place? Weird skies, even weirder enemies..." while I take aim at one of this creatures. I release the perfect shot on my mark, hitting it so much power, it became a push-shot back into some old weathered bench rendering this quite dead.

After Leon commanded Aviana to go inside the house where Casimar still is, he sees a slightly better dressed rat on top of the old ruins across the street. This one wears a robe, simple short sword and a hand crossbow, this could be there leader. He fires his crossbow at Leon again and yells something I could barely hear, it sounded like broken common, but I could not really make out what it was shouting.

Leon runs in to fight this leader type, as the other 2 rat-folk scurry off into the distance. All eyes on Leon now fighting this bogey, taking serious damage as the rat is ferociously fast and cunning. The rest of the party is now involved in defeating this sly creature.

Before our eyes we saw Leon falling to ground, Gervian drops his bow and starts running in to protect his comrade from dying even more. Casimar and Echo also taking turn shooting and firing at this leader.
After taking some substantial damage, he decided to tuck tail and run off, giving me some space to heal up Leon a bit.

"Skrix is coming back for you!" We hear the leader shouting from the top of a ruined building as a final warning before disappearing completely. Thus concluding a short little battle.

Having some time to see and collect which of the arrows are still usable and inspect the bodies of the rat-folk we took down.
Upon closer inspection of one of them, I discovered it had some glass like fibers stuck in it's gums and between it's teeth.
But alas, no valuables or notion of whom they are, where we are or what so ever.

> What is this glass-like dust?

As Echo and Leon went on a scouting trip to see for better options to rest than in the building we just checked out, Casimar and Gervian got cozy inside that very same building. As having a beer and a cozy fire wasn't enough, also decided on setting a trap up the back ally to provide a little protection, or perhaps, dinner, this cabbage is not gonna last me very long anyway.

After about 2 hours, the scouting party came back telling us about an old guardhouse they found, near a bell tower. It did sound a lot better than this shit hole, although we made a fire, it was promised to have a lockable door and barred windows. So we decided rest there for the rest of the day and night. Nobody really even know what time of day it was, but the portal seemed to shook up things a little.

When we got there, we locked the door and took some time to ourself, patching our wounds a little and talking about what all just happened. Echo could not resist questioning our "new" green faced friend whom is still amongst us somehow.

Aviana told us that she has been in Rivenrijk for about 200 to 300 years, how she got there is a little vague, but apparently *PooF*. She had enough time to figure out how to get back, and us to find all the artifacts she needed to do so. She also tells us that used to live about hour away from this place, on the edge of the forest, this town we are in is probably called **Tura**, she recons.

At some point we all dose off for our nights' rest and luckily survived it. Waking up, not feeling rested at all, experiencing a heavy feeling, severe headaches, we have our breakfast meeting with a rainy background. Concluded Aviana is gonna try and show us the way to her old house. We also discussed the mode of transportation, perhaps with the help of Aviana, but alas, she cannot shift into a draft horse to pull the wagon we say at our old location. *sigh.* Walking it is then!

We opened to the door, seeing a blackened, thunder roaring sky. Rain is pouring down. Feeling heavy, we walk out, rain touching our skins, but it did not feel like rain, it felt thicker and more sticky; looking at it, it is goddamn blood. Paying a little closer attention to our surroundings we see sort of the same streets, yet different. Thick vines with thorns now wrapped around buildings and other objects making to hard to navigate, but we still seem to head in the right direction according to Aviana.

Along our travels we found a curious note saying:

```
Voor eenieder die dit leest.

Het is nu pak 'm beet 6 maanden sinds de de lucht boven onze prachtige stad werden verlicht met de meest profetische vertoningen van kleuren. En dezelfde aantal dagen sinds die prachtige kleuren onze stad vernietigden. En nu, 6 maanden na deze profetische catastrofe, wie nu, beschermd ons tegen deze chaos die de stad van dag tot dag doet veranderen? Dit vraag ik aan u! Maar eerst zal ik mijn eigen visie delenâ€¦

Het is mijn meest vereerde mening dat terwijl Ilmater altijd onze beschermheer zal blijven, zijn welwillendheid nooit meer zal schijnen op de verdorven en ellendige inwoners die deze stad populeren. En zo is het dat in het neerstrijken van onze stad de wijze Ilmater ons de weg heeft laten zien. Hij heeft het teken gegeven om deze plek te verlaten, om verder te kijken, om buiten deze verdoemde stad te stappen en door de poort de wijdere wereld te betreden.

En voor de wijzen die gaan, die gaan niet alleen. Deze publicatie is gewijd aan het verspreiden van nieuws aan al Ilmater zijn kinderen. Het is ons duidelijk dat onze missie daar ligt, door de poort naar buiten. En zo, oh lezer, waar eerst wij vanuit vuile kantoren werkten werken wij nu vanaf een simpele wagen met daarop een drukpers gebonden en alles wat wij nodig zullen hebben aan de andere kant van de poort.

Kom met ons mee nu, en loop met ons deze prachtige en glorieuze nieuwe ochtend tegemoet!

After taking this note and walking some more, we arrived at a high fortified wall with a portcullis, which of course is closed. As we approach the portcullis, we see 2 guards standing watch. Being guards they obviously do not clock us directly, also looking in the opposite direction, so we have to ask if they can open the gates so we can get out of this bloody rain. Happily the guards comply and let us pass through. Distorted by being in this horror scenery we seem to have entered "the normal world" somehow. Asking the guards where we are isn't yet very helpful, but again they are guards, their answer was "**Lockhead Gate**".
